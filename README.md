## Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamental techniques of digital image processing using Python. Through practical examples, it showcases how to read, visualize, manipulate, and transform images using libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## 🔧 Features Implemented
- 📥 Image Loading (RGB & Grayscale)
- 🎨 Color Channel Separation (Red, Green, Blue intensity maps)
- 📐 Image Translation (shifting images in x and y directions)
- 🔄 Image Rotation (with custom angle and scale)
- 🔲 Cropping Selected Area (with rectangle drawing for preview)

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Pixel manipulation
- Matrix transformations (Affine, Rotation)
- Grayscale conversion
- Visualizing individual RGB channels
- Cropping using array slicing
